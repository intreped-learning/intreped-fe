       "description": "Some might see this technique as a practice in futility or pure madness; I think 100% is essential to maintaining an authoritative (in the sense you have control) voice in your classroom without having to resort to draconian discipline. \n\nTechnique 36: 100 percent, is the idea that when teaching you must always have 100 percent compliance in your classroom. As a teacher you have to make 100 percent the standard, not the goal. It means that what you request gets done and what you request is moving your classroom towards maximum efficiency. \n\nThe technique is very involved and has a lot of value, so I wanted to break it up into more manageable chunks. This video is part 1 of 4.",

        "description": "Some might see this technique as a practice in futility or pure madness; I think 100% is essential to maintaining an authoritative (in the sense you have control) voice in your classroom without having to resort to draconian discipline. \n\nTechnique 36: 100 percent, is the idea that when teaching you must always have 100 percent compliance in your classroom. As a teacher you have to make 100 percent the standard, not the goal. It means that what you request gets done and what you request is moving your classroom towards maximum efficiency. \n\nThe technique is very involved and has a lot of value, so I wanted to break it up into more manageable chunks. This video is part 1 of 4."

With this awareness, educators can recognize and avoid the unconscious behaviors that often contribute to climates unfavorable for youth in STEM classrooms or activities. Culturally responsive teaching empowers girls by respecting and incorporating their interests, identities, cultures, backgrounds, and experiences as central to the learning process, and are particularly effective in motivating and engaging girls of color in STEM.",
